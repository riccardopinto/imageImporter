# importImages function

Note: The funcion assumes the urls are written one per line and that they are all valid since this is supposed to be part of a bigger project and since it wasn't in the requirements the validation step was skipped. The images are stored with the add of a jpg extension to avoid images saved in raw numbers (some OS can have a problem with this). This could not be optimal for any situation, but it satisfied the test scenario that was given by email.
